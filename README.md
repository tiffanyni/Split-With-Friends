There is the feature of adding your own friends to the friend list, personalizing the app to be your very own management tool. In the split-bill window, the user can type in how much of the bill is their portion, as well as select which person is paying the bill. The result of this transaction will be dynamically reflected in the friend list showing how much you owe your friend or that friend owes you.
